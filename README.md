# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

This project was designed to help me put my HTML and CSS tool understanding to the test. This challenge solves the problem of replacing the divs with HTML elements and formating CSS so that it will fix the webpage. Because of this I learned how to properly use CSS through trial and error as well as comparing the changes needed to be done to the inspected example to get a rough idea of what was still needed in order to be completed. This Project stands out to me due to the fact that just changing the divs to elements could have such an effect of the entire webpage as a whole.
